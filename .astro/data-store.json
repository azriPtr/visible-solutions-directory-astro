It specifies the performance requirements for thief-resistant locks used on external timber doors. A lock meeting this standard has been rigorously tested and certified to withstand techniques commonly used by burglars.\n\nThe standard was introduced to create a universal benchmark for home security. When an insurer asks if you have \"five-lever mortice deadlocks\" they are almost always referring to locks that meet BS3621.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"callout\">\n\n#### KEY FEATURES OF BS3621 LOCKS\n\n- Minimum of 5 levers (or equivalent security pins)\n- Anti-drill plates to protect the internal mechanism\n- Box that must extend at least 20mm into the door\n- Must be bolt-action from both sides of the door\n\n\u003C/div>\n\n## How to Identify a Compliant Lock\n\nYou do not need to disassemble your lock to check your lock's rating. The identification markings are visible on the **faceplate**—the metal strip visible on the edge of the door when it opens.\n\n![BS3621 faceplate identification markings on a lock mechanism](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=BS3621+Lock+Faceplate+Identification)\n*Figure 1: The BS3621 markings are stamped on the faceplate alongside the manufacturer's branding*\n\nIf your lock's faceplate displays the **B3621** (a less stage formed by a continuous line) across the faceplate by the firm like Union, Chubb, or Avocet, your lock is compliant.

A professional survey can identify weak points. Navigate back to our [main search page](/search) to request quotes from verified specialists in your area.\n\n\u003C/div>\n\n## Insurance Implications\n\nBurglary claims are often rejected on the grounds of \"failure to maintain minimum security.\" If your policy states that a BS3621 lock is required on the \"final exit door\" and you have a non-approved lock instead, the insurer may argue that you breached the contract terms. In such a case, they could refuse the insurance policy payout carefully, checking wording that mentions:\n\n- \"Approved locks as defined by BSI 3621\"\n- \"Five-lever mortice deadlock\"\n- \"British Standard locks where fitted\"\n\n### Standard Grades Comparison\n\n| Standard | Door Type | Key Requirement |\n|----------|-----------|-----------------|\n| BS 3621 | Timber | Keyoperate (Standard) |\n| BS 8621 | Timber/Flat | Thumbturn (Egress) |\n| BS 10621 | Timber | Lockable from outside only |\n\n## Standards for uPVC and Composite Doors\n\nBS3621 specifically applies to mortice locks usually found on wooden doors. Modern uPVC and composite doors use center multipoint locking systems. For these doors, insurers look for:\n\n- **TS007 3-Star Cylinder:** A high-security cylinder that resists snapping\n- **SS312 Diamond:** A bolt-secure standard indicating the highest level of cylinder resistance.\n\n## Common Questions\n\n### Can I install a BS3621 lock myself?\n\nWhile possible for those with carpentry skills, improperly fitted locks can fail under stress or potentially cause warping in the door. You could void liability in case the lock itself is not correctly fitted or springs for the wood, which would require the security benefits of the lock to be revoked.\n\n### Are all 5-lever locks BS3621 compliant?\n\nNo. You can buy 5-lever mortice locks that also haven't been tested or certified to the British Standard. Always check for the markings.\n\n---\n\n*This guide was last updated in October 2023. Insurance requirements may vary by provider.

In such a case, they could refuse the insurance policy payout carefully, checking wording that mentions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>“Approved locks as defined by BSI 3621”\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“Five-lever mortice deadlock”\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“British Standard locks where fitted”\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"standard-grades-comparison\">Standard Grades Comparison\u003C/h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003Ctable>\u003Cthead>\u003Ctr>\u003Cth>Standard\u003C/th>\u003Cth>Door Type\u003C/th>\u003Cth>Key Requirement\u003C/th>\u003C/tr>\u003C/thead>\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>BS 3621\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>Timber\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>Keyoperate (Standard)\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>BS 8621\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>Timber/Flat\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>Thumbturn (Egress)\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>BS 10621\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>Timber\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>Lockable from outside only\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003C/tbody>\u003C/table>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"standards-for-upvc-and-composite-doors\">Standards for uPVC and Composite Doors\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>BS3621 specifically applies to mortice locks usually found on wooden doors.
