Based in Edgbaston, Brum City Security has provided residential locksmith services across Birmingham since 2014. Owned and operated by Mark Thompson, the business specializes in non-destructive entry and uPVC door mechanism failures.

Unlike national call centers, you speak directly to the locksmith who will attend your property. Mark carries stock for 90% of common lock types (Yale, Era, Avocet, etc.) to ensure most jobs are completed in a single visit.

The company holds valid DBS checks (updated annually) and Public Liability Insurance covering up to £5 million.
