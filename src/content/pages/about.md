## Who we are

Visible Solutions LLC is a US-based digital marketing agency specializing in high-performance directory solutions and lead generation for the trades. We operate this platform as an independent bridge, ensuring UK consumers have access to verified local locksmiths through a modern, AI-enhanced interface.

## What we do

We provide Directory Services for consumers and Marketing & SaaS Services for locksmith members. We provide the tools—including listings management, review aggregation, and secure quote routing—that enable local professionals to manage their digital presence effectively in an increasingly competitive market.

## Our Role in the UK Market

We act as a neutral technology provider. We are not a locksmith chain, and we do not employ locksmiths directly. Our responsibility is to maintain the integrity of the data and the efficiency of the routing technology. We exist to facilitate the connection, not to perform the physical labor.
